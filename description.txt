ParticleLibrary is a library that aims to improve upon the existing Dusts system in Terraria by creating a Particle system focused on control and fidelity.

Modders who do not plan to modify the library should rely on the library as a mod reference, as this is the safest dependency route.
Modders who plan to modify the library are highly encouraged to open a PR to the repo on GitHub once the changes are tested and verified as safe.

Modders and Players are encouraged to report bugs and talk about improvements in our server.
