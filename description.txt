[h1] Particle Library [/h1]
ParticleLibrary is a library that aims to improve upon the existing Dust and Particle systems in Terraria by creating a Particle system focused on control and fidelity.
[b] Note that this mod does not change gameplay unless explicitly used by other mods. [/b]

[h1] Particles [/h1]
Particles are modeled to feel much like Projectiles. They have AI and Draw methods. They also have a Layer, which determines their place in the draw order.

[h1] Emitters [/h1]
Emitters are much like Particles, however they are designed to be stationary. They can optionally save and load with the world, and they have AI and Draw methods. They can also store data in the form of a string.

[h1] Usage & Installation [/h1]
[b] Please note that this library uses the GPU v3.0 license. Essentially this just means that if you use my code, you must open-source your code as well. [/b]
