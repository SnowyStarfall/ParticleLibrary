Built for 1.4 Alpha version of tModLoader.
ParticleLibrary is a library that aims to improve upon the existing Dusts system in Terraria by creating a Particle system focused on control and fidelity.
Note that this mod does not change gameplay unless explicitly used by other mods.

Modders who do not plan to modify the library should rely on the library as a strong mod reference, as this is the safest dependency route.
Modders who plan to modify the library are highly encouraged to open a PR to the repo on GitHub once the changes are tested and verified as safe.

Modders and Players are encouraged to report bugs and talk about improvements in our server.
